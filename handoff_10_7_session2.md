# Tech Stack Audit Tool - Handoff Document
**Date:** October 7, 2025 - Session 2  
**Status:** Testing in progress - fixing GPT-5 temperature compatibility  
**Repository:** simplified_TSAT

---

## Current State Summary

### What We Accomplished This Session

1. **Reviewed repository structure** - Confirmed all core files are in place
2. **Started test suite** - `python tests/test_simple_audit.py`
3. **Identified GPT-5 compatibility issue** - Temperature parameter not supported
4. **Applied fix** - Removed temperature settings, updated defaults to `gpt-5`

### Test Results (Before Fix)
✅ TEST 1: CSV Loading - PASSED
✅ TEST 2: Quick Research (2 tools) - PASSED
❌ TEST 3: Integration Analysis - FAILED (temperature error)
❌ TEST 4: Report Generation - FAILED (temperature error)
⏸️  TEST 5: Complete Workflow - IN PROGRESS when stopped

**Error Message:**
litellm.BadRequestError: OpenAIException - Unsupported value: 'temperature' does not support 0.3/0.4 with this model. Only the default (1) value is supported.

## Files Changed This Session

### 1. core/integration_analyzer.py
**Line ~14-16:**
```python
# BEFORE:
self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model=os.getenv("OPENAI_MODEL", "gpt-4"),
    temperature=0.3
)

# AFTER:
self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model=os.getenv("OPENAI_MODEL", "gpt-5")
)
2. core/report_writer.py
Line ~19-21:
python# BEFORE:
self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model=os.getenv("OPENAI_MODEL", "gpt-4"),
    temperature=0.4
)

User's Environment

Python Environment: crewai_cleanenv (Anaconda)
OpenAI Model: GPT-5 (set in .env)
Operating System: Windows (MINGW64)
Working Directory: ~/Desktop/AI_Consultancy_Project/2-Personal_Projects/simplified_TSAT


What Should Happen Next
1. Test Results Expected
After the temperature fix, all 5 tests should pass:

✅ Test 1: CSV Loading
✅ Test 2: Quick Research (2 tools)
✅ Test 3: Integration Analysis
✅ Test 4: Report Generation
✅ Test 5: Complete Workflow (3 tools)

2. If Tests Pass
User can run their first real audit:
bashpython simple_audit.py data/cga_real_tools.csv "Client Name"
This will:

Research all 17 tools from the CSV
Analyze integration opportunities
Generate a markdown report in output/ folder

3. If Tests Still Fail
Check for:

Is .env set correctly with OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5?
Are the temperature lines definitely removed from both files?
Does pip list show all required packages from requirements.txt?


Key Architecture Points
Single-Pass Workflow (No Stage Gates!)
CSV Input → Research Tools → Analyze Integrations → Generate Report
Three CrewAI Agents

Tool Researcher (core/tool_researcher.py)

Researches each tool's updates (2-year lookback)
Uses API registry when available
Falls back to web research
Runs in parallel for all tools


Integration Analyzer (core/integration_analyzer.py)

Analyzes complete stack holistically
Identifies cross-tool automation opportunities
Focuses on n8n (open source) workflows
Has FULL context of all tool research


Report Writer (core/report_writer.py)

Creates client-ready markdown report
Prioritizes opportunities by ROI
Provides implementation roadmap
Saves to output/ folder



Important: No Manual Databases!

System researches fresh info every time
No quarterly maintenance required
LLMs do autonomous research and synthesis


Known Issues & Open Questions
GPT-5 Compatibility

Issue: GPT-5 doesn't support custom temperature settings
Fix Applied: Removed temperature parameters
Status: Testing in progress

Research Results (from Test 2)
FactSet: 0 updates found (Status: Unknown)
Morningstar Direct: 0 updates found (Status: Unknown)
Bloomberg Terminal: 5 updates found ✅ (via CrewAI web research)
Question for next session: Why did FactSet and Morningstar return 0 updates?

Both have API endpoints in the registry
May need API credentials to access
Or the API research isn't fully implemented yet
Web research works (see Bloomberg Terminal success)


User's Goals (From PROJECT_INTENT.md)
Business Need
As a technology consultant for financial advisory firms, user needs to audit clients' tech stacks to deliver:

What they have - Current software inventory
What's new - Updates from last 2 years they might have missed
What's possible - Automation opportunities using n8n
What to do - Actionable recommendations

Success Criteria

✅ Fast (< 30 minutes per audit)
✅ Automated (minimal manual work)
✅ Accurate (LLM-researched, not stale databases)
✅ Actionable (specific recommendations)
✅ Zero maintenance (no quarterly updates)
✅ Scalable (works for any software stack)
✅ Client-ready (professional markdown report)

Open Source Focus

Use n8n (not Zapier/Make)
Client owns the solution
No vendor lock-in


Commands Reference
Run Tests
bashpython tests/test_simple_audit.py
Run Audit (after tests pass)
bashpython simple_audit.py data/cga_real_tools.csv "Client Name"

# With options:
python simple_audit.py data/cga_real_tools.csv "Client Name" --years 3 --depth deep
Check Environment
bash# Verify .env exists and has:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5

# Verify packages installed
pip list | grep crewai
pip list | grep openai

Important Files to Review

PROJECT_INTENT.md - The north star, defines what to build and what NOT to build
FINAL_HANDOFF.md - Previous session's lessons learned about over-engineering
README.md - Quick start guide and troubleshooting
simple_audit.py - Main orchestrator, shows the complete workflow


Next AI Assistant Should...

Check test results - Ask user if tests passed after the temperature fix
If tests passed - Guide user through first real audit
If tests failed - Debug the specific errors
Review the 0 updates issue - Why did FactSet/Morningstar return no results?
Verify output quality - When first report is generated, review it with user


Critical Reminders from PROJECT_INTENT.md
✅ What We're Doing RIGHT

Single-pass workflow (no stage gates)
CrewAI researches everything automatically
Integration analyzer has full context
Open source focus (n8n)

❌ What to AVOID

No stage gates - Keep it simple
No manual databases - LLMs research everything
No dummy data - If we can't check it, don't generate it
No quarterly maintenance - System researches fresh info every time


Session Summary
Started with: Repository review, confirmed all files in place
Identified: GPT-5 temperature compatibility issue
Fixed: Removed temperature settings, updated defaults to gpt-5
Status: User running tests now
Next: Verify tests pass, then run first real audit
