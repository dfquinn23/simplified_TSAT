# Tech Stack Audit Report: Test Client

Audit Date: October 07, 2025

## Executive Summary
- Scope: Rapid audit of Test Client’s CRM stack to identify automation and integration opportunities with an emphasis on open-source n8n workflows.
- Total tools analyzed: 1
- Key findings: The CRM (Test Tool 1) recently introduced an API enhancement that enables faster, more reliable data synchronization. This unlocks immediate opportunities to automate data syncs, lead routing, and data hygiene with low-to-medium implementation effort and measurable time savings for Sales operations.
- Total opportunities identified: 3
- Estimated total time savings: 4–8 hours per week (≈16–32 hours per month). At a conservative blended cost of $50/hour, this equates to $800–$1,600/month in productivity gains.

## Tools Analyzed

- Tool: Test Tool 1 (CRM)
  - Recent updates discovered:
    - API Enhancement: Faster data sync performance
  - Key automation features added:
    - Enhanced API responsiveness supports higher-frequency polling and larger batch operations using n8n HTTP Request nodes without hitting timeouts or long runtimes.
    - Improved reliability for near-real-time data pipelines between CRM and downstream systems.
  - Current utilization assessment:
    - Given the identified need to “Automate data sync between systems using n8n HTTP nodes,” API capabilities appear underutilized today. Current processes likely rely on manual exports/imports or ad-hoc updates, creating delays and data inconsistencies that can be eliminated with n8n automations.

## Integration Opportunities

1) Automated Data Sync between CRM and Downstream Systems
- Tools involved: Test Tool 1 (CRM) + target system(s) with REST/CSV endpoints (e.g., analytics, marketing, finance)
- Current manual process: Periodic manual CSV exports/imports or ad-hoc updates to keep systems aligned; error-prone and delayed.
- Proposed n8n workflow:
  - Trigger: Scheduled (Cron) every 15–60 minutes.
  - Steps: HTTP Request (GET updated CRM records since last run) → Transform (n8n Function nodes for mapping/normalization) → HTTP Request (POST/PUT to target system) → Upsert logic with idempotency keys → Error handling/retries → Logging (n8n executions + optional webhook to a log collector) → Failure notifications (email).
  - Extras: Pagination handling, rate limiting, and incremental checkpoints stored in n8n.
- Time savings estimate: 2–4 hours/week by removing manual sync tasks and follow-up corrections.
- Implementation complexity: Medium (varies with number of target systems and mapping depth).
- Priority: High

2) Real-Time Lead Routing and Notifications
- Tools involved: Test Tool 1 (CRM) + email (SMTP) or an open-source chat tool (e.g., Mattermost) for alerts
- Current manual process: Sales Ops or reps manually assign new leads and notify owners by email/chat; delays slow speed-to-lead.
- Proposed n8n workflow:
  - Trigger: Poll CRM for new leads every 1–5 minutes or use available webhook/trigger endpoints if supported.
  - Steps: Apply assignment rules (round-robin, territory, or account owner match) → HTTP Request to update lead owner in CRM → Send notification via SMTP or Mattermost → Log assignments for audit.
- Time savings estimate: 1–2 hours/week plus faster response times that can improve conversion rates.
- Implementation complexity: Low (rules-based logic and standard notifications).
- Priority: High

3) Duplicate Detection and Data Hygiene Automation (Phase 1: Detect; Phase 2: Resolve)
- Tools involved: Test Tool 1 (CRM)
- Current manual process: Reps/Sales Ops periodically search for duplicates and fix by hand.
- Proposed n8n workflow:
  - Trigger: Nightly schedule.
  - Steps: HTTP Request to fetch contacts/accounts → Normalize fields (email domain, phone digits) → Fuzzy match (e.g., Levenshtein/Jaro in Function node) to identify likely duplicates → Output a dedupe report (CSV via email) or write to a Google Sheet-equivalent → Optional: Create CRM tasks for review → Phase 2: merge or update via CRM API with controlled rules.
- Time savings estimate: 1–2 hours/week and improved data quality reduces downstream rework.
- Implementation complexity: Medium (matching logic tuning; Phase 2 merge logic adds complexity).
- Priority: Medium

## Quick Wins

- Lead Routing and Notifications (Opportunity 2)
  - Why: Minimal integration scope; direct impact on speed-to-lead and rep productivity.
  - Timeline: 0.5–1 day to implement basic rules and notifications.
- Automated One-Way Data Sync (Opportunity 1, limited scope)
  - Why: Immediate reduction of manual exports/imports for a single target system or dataset.
  - Timeline: 2–3 days for one source-to-target mapping with logging and retries.
- Duplicate Detection Report (Opportunity 3, detection-only)
  - Why: Improves data quality fast without risky merges; informs future cleanup.
  - Timeline: 1–2 days to deliver a nightly report and owner notifications.

## Implementation Roadmap

- Phase 1: Quick Wins (Weeks 1–2)
  - Stand up n8n (self-hosted, Docker) with secure credentials storage.
  - Implement Lead Routing and Notifications with basic assignment rules and email/Mattermost alerts.
  - Build One-Way Data Sync for 1 priority target (e.g., marketing or analytics) with field mapping, pagination, retries, and error notifications.
  - Launch Duplicate Detection Report (no auto-merge), including summary email to Sales Ops.

- Phase 2: Medium Complexity (Weeks 3–6)
  - Expand Data Sync coverage to additional targets and/or add bi-directional upserts with idempotency keys and conflict checks.
  - Enhance Lead Routing with territory rules, vacation calendars, and SLA breach alerts.
  - Add dashboarding for workflow health (n8n executions, failure rate, latency); implement secrets rotation policy.
  - Tune duplicate detection thresholds; add “one-click” review/approve loop (review in sheet → n8n reads approved merges → apply via API with rollback plan).

- Phase 3: Advanced Integrations (Weeks 7–12)
  - Full bi-directional sync with conflict resolution policies and audit trails.
  - Introduce staging workflows and automated tests for mappings and transformations.
  - Implement performance tuning (batch sizes, concurrency) aligned to CRM API limits.
  - Add observability (webhook to log collector/Prometheus), SLA monitoring, and monthly optimization reviews.

Notes on Open-Source and Security
- n8n is open-source and supports self-hosting, aligning with cost control and data residency needs.
- Use least-privilege API scopes, rotate secrets quarterly, and enable execution logs with access controls.
- Start with detection-only data hygiene to minimize risk; add controlled merges after UAT and policy approval.

Estimated Business Impact (Consolidated)
- Time savings: 4–8 hours/week from reduced manual syncs, faster lead handling, and automated data hygiene.
- Quality gains: Fresher, more consistent customer data improves reporting and campaign effectiveness.
- Revenue impact: Faster speed-to-lead and cleaner data typically lift conversion rates; expect measurable improvements within the first quarter post-implementation.
